# Classification Project

**Why are our customers churning?**
*Some questions I have include:*

- *Could the month in which they signed up influence churn? i.e. if a cohort is identified by tenure, is there a cohort or cohorts who have a higher rate of churn than other cohorts? (Plot the rate of churn on a line chart where x is the tenure and y is the rate of churn (customers churned/total customers))* **(Definitely answer this question)**
- *Are there features that indicate a higher propensity to churn? like type of internet service, type of phone service, online security and backup, senior citizens, paying more than x% of customers with the same services, etc.?*
- *Is there a price threshold for specific services where the likelihood of churn increases once price for those services goes past that point? If so, what is that point for what service(s)?* **(Definitely answer this question)**
- *If we looked at churn rate for month-to-month customers after the 12th month and that of 1-year contract customers after the 12th month, are those rates comparable?* **(Definitely answer this question)**

## #Specific Deliverables:
- a **jupyter notebook** where your work takes place
- a **csv file** that predicts churn for each customer
- **`acquire.py`**, **`prepare.py`**, **`model.py`** (you may decide to separate tasks into others, such as `preprocessing.py` or `features.py`)
- a **google slide presentation** summarizing your model
- a **`README.md`** file that contains a link to your google slides presentation, and instructions for how to use your python script(s)

## Maggie's Notes
**Target for early today**
1. Project Plan
    - get data
    - drop nulls
    - make sure dtype / target can be used in model
    - develop a model, train & evaluate
Baseline 1 is average, Baseline 2 is model as described above

**Target for Later**
2. Answering required questions
