# Maggie's Notes

1. **Project Plan**
    - goals, summary
    - ?s to answer / hypothesis
        - required vs nice-to-haves
    - Data dictionary

2. **Baseline**
    - get data
    - drop nulls (cols or rows)
    - make sure target is numeric
    - be sure datatypes can be used in model
        - remove variables with types that cannot be used
    - run a decision tree model
    - evaluate: is accuracy better than baeline?

3. **MVP**
    - Answer required questions 
        - define what "answered" means - what is *good enough* (thru viz/stats test)?
    - use more features
    - encode so they can be used in other algorithms
    - pairplot
    - scale as needed
    - compute new features suggested in proj summary
    - train new algorithm; evaluate
    - train using different hyperparameters; evaluate
    - presentation
        - get the contents on the slides
        - formatting should be done next time around

4. **Refine Part 1**
    - nulls imputed
    - ary feature deltas?
        - new selecton? 
        - remove selection?
    - finalize presentation w/formatting

5. **Refine Part 2**
    - more feature engineering
    - more modeling
        - new hyperparameters
    - answer more questions in explore
